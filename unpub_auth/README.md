# unpub_auth

Only for Dart 2.15 and later.

Since Dart 2.15:

1. The `accessToken` is only sent to https://pub.dev and https://pub.dartlang.org. See [dart-lang/pub #3007](https://github.com/dart-lang/pub/pull/3007) for details.
2. Since Dart 2.15, the third-party pub's token is stored at `/Users/username/Library/Application Support/dart/pub-tokens.json` (macOS)

So the self-hosted pub server should have its own auth flow. unpub is using Google OAuth2 by default.

`unpub_auth login` will generate `unpub-credentials.json` locally after developer login the `unpub_auth`.
Before calling `dart pub publish` or `flutter pub publish`, please call `unpub_auth get | dart pub token add <self-hosted-pub-server>` first.
`unpub_auth get` will refresh the token. New accessToken will be write to `pub-tokens.json` by `dart pub token add <self-hosted-pub-server>`.
So you can always use a valid accessToken in `dart pub publish` and `flutter pub publish`.

## Usage

### Overview

unpub is using Google OAuth2 by default. There's two situations where the unpub_auth can be used.

1. Login locally, and publish pub packages locally.
  step 1. Call `unpub_auth login` when you first use it, and it will save credentials locally.
  step 2. Before calling `dart pub publish` or `flutter pub publish`, call `unpub_auth get | dart pub token add <self-hosted-pub-server>`

2. Login locally, and publish pub packages from CI/CD.
   On CI/CD host device, you may not have opportunity to call `unpub_auth login`, so you can use `unpub_auth migrate` to migrate the credentials file.
  step 1. In local device, call `unpub_auth login` when you first use it, and it will save credentials locally.
  step 2. Copy the credentials file which was generated in step 1 to CI/CD device.
  step 3. In CI/CD device, call `unpub_auth migrate <credentials-file-path>`, so the CI/CD will have the same credentials file.
  step 4. In CI/CD device, before calling `dart pub publish` or `flutter pub publish`, call `unpub_auth get | dart pub token add <self-hosted-pub-server>`
